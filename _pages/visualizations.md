<h2>Data viz is something I am passionate about!</h2>
<h4>As a geographer, how could you not be?</h4>

Here are some of my favorite visualizations from my research, and what they mean:

<div style="flex: 3; min-width: 300px;">
<br>
<strong>Example 1:</strong> Figure 2 from my 2024 publication:
<br>
<img src="/images/MAUP_example_map.jpeg">
 <strong>O'Connor, C.</strong><em>, et al.</em> 2023. Assessing the impact of areal unit selection and the modifiable areal unit problem on associative statistics between cases of tick-borne disease and entomological indices. <em>J Med Entomol.</em>, tjad157. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjad157">https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjad157</a>
</div>

<div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
<br>
 <br>

 This figure demonstrates the visual biases that occur when an underlying continuous phenomenon is aggregated into areal units. Here, I took a point pattern of anaplasmosis cases, and aggregated them into various meaningful (Counties and Zip Code Tabulation Areas) and non-meaningful (Voronoi) polygons. Clearly, the a point-process can appear more widespread when aggregated into larger units.

<strong>Example 2:</strong> Figure 4 from my 2022 publication:

<img src="/images/B117_tree_1_12.jpeg">
Russell, A., <strong>O’Connor, C.</strong>, Lasek-Nesselquist, E., <em>et al.</em> Spatiotemporal Analyses of 2 Co-Circulating
SARS-CoV-2 Variants, New York State, USA. <em>Emerg Infect Dis.</em>, 28(3). doi:&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2803.211972">https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2803.211972</a>

<br>

Though quite busy (phylogeographic analysis is quite complex!), this figure is just fun to look at. The analysis we conducted involved examining SARS-CoV-2 genetic variant data from GISAID, particularly the B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 variants, to compare their spread into and around New York State.

<br>
<br>

The general takeaway of the study, was that the B.1.526 variant (which emerged in New York City), exhibited a dominant outward spread consistent with implications from the founder effect. Comparatively, the internationally-imported B.1.1.7 variant exhibited outbreaks in less populated areas, due to it's competitive advantage in infectivity. This figure in particular, demonstrates that B.1.1.7 was imported into NYS, primarily the finger-lakes region, from various domestic sources.

<strong>Example 3:</strong> Figure 1 from my 2024 pre-print:

<img src="/images/3_3_example.jpeg">

<strong>O’Connor, C.</strong>, Aldstadt, J., & Wilson, A. (2024). Examining patch and landscape-level white-tailed deer connectivity using a novel, buffer and resistance-based metric. doi: <a href = "https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4655632/v1">https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4655632/v1</a>
</div>
<div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">

<br>
<br>

This figure serves as an example for the novel metric for forest connectivity I developed, called <em>sinuous connection reduction</em>. 

<br>
<br>

<em>Sinuous connection reduction</em> is calculated in two parts, first, the size of the focal forest patch (shown in red) and second, the inverse sinuousity of the least-cost paths between adjacent forest patches (shown in blue.) Higher values of inverse sinuousity are shown here by going down rows, and higher values of focal forest patch area are shown by going across columns. The result is the forest with the highest <em>sinuous connection reduction</em> is shown at the bottom right, and the lowest is at the top left.
